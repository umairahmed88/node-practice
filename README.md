This is for my practice
insatlling Node Js on linux
Step 1: Open your terminal or press Ctrl + Alt + T.
Step 2: sudo apt install nodejs
Step 3: to verify node installed enter command node -v or node â€“version

**NODE JS** It is JS run time like an environment in which a program written in JS we execute, outside of any browser

**fs** file system, we would access for reading, writing data
fs.readFileSync is a synchronus method to read file, this function needs two arguments, 1st path to the file, 2nd is character encoding i.e
fs.readFileSync('path', characterencoding);

for writing 
fs.writeFileSync the arguments will be ('path', fileName)

**Creating Simple Server**
it needs a package http i.e **{const http = require('http')}**

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello from the server')
}

server.listen(8000, "127.0.0.1", () => {
	console.log("Listening on port 8000");
});
